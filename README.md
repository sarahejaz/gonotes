# gonotes

goNotes.ipynb contains all the code dealing with audio and text: extraction of audio, analysis of audio features such as amplitude and frequency, extraction of keywords and key sentences, and so on. The code is to be run on Google Colab.

It also contains Flask code that uses Ngrok to run on Google Colab. The last cell of goNotes.ipynb runs the Flask server. The HTML pages used for the frontend are in the templates folder.
