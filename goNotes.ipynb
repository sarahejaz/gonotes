            "good morning welcome to you today's networking discussion on professor canard. we are here to go through chapter one of the text which is introduced to networking we. you be talking about what the purpose of network is for mainly the different types of devices as well as addressing the types of networks that you have and their applications.. we use different terms in networking that you'll see throughout the course o you hear network services. you might also hear the term application the purposes a network is there to share different types of what we call resources or resource could be a something as simple as a file or printer it could be a website. could be an entire er pea system so that we'll use the term resource as well as application under the hood. you might hearts use the term service or eaten farther under the surface. we might say protocol there are different types of applications that you'll see discussed in the text client server and peaked a pear being the two main types but you'll see others mentioned as well.. so if client server as you'll seen the listing that's the dominant type of networks that we see to day terms of application if. you see the list web e mal others it will get through throughout the course. but you can see those are really the man types of applications of fined to day there again. refer to as client servers. o be slide here. you can see the intricate which some people confuse from being the webthat. it's not the same thing. so the internet being the infrastructure. the series of connections of networks the users requesting a web page a vile wet browser that's the sompward running up their machine known is the client and h. you have web servers were running on the web servant will get more into that f future chapters other examples. e mal soy. we can say emails the application under the hood. there are a set of of one or more protocols that provide that service to the application so here you can see example such as sem t p pop three lots of alphabet suit the semester and will get into all of them. fa print a little that more basic but. that two represents in tapwlik application if i want to make files available devices such as printers available than you need to make those resources of elle somehow on the net that could be done in a fairly simple environment known is needed appear which is to say each system has a something that it's sharing a particular resource and then the other machines are functioning as clients that ae requesting the services on that particular machine. wet. you don't see in that slide. is any mention upper particular server. so it's a little bit simpler of a set up. oh the long hall can get a la bit more complicated so you can seen the slide there. it's simple for small networks. it's an expensive because you don't need complicated servoroperating systems. but you can see the problems are doesn't scale well. it doesn't grow as your needs change. and it's also not a secure. so client servigeyou cancer here being more dominant type of what you might call an administrative mob so all of the security los of the services might be a isolated on one or maybe several machines and then the clients are simply requesting those services from those one or more service that you have so nos network operatingsystem that would be something like serve orgyou candy on the slide or lines of popular servoroperating system as well.. now we will be getting into ah the different components hat you need for the network. so the application technically as one component. but as we get into more hardware types of things you'll see some devices mentioned in this live there or least in the diagram oe can see a switch mentioned as a particular device will see others such as hubs routers wireless access points and more that diagram also also referring to a particular typology or the design of the network that physical apologies you can see as what's known as a star topology sometimes called hub and spoke this like shows a combination of topology. so you have three separate devices that are connecting may be three separate class rooms three separate buildings three separate offices. and then they are all ar connected together on what's known as a bus topology a single line connecting them altogether.. larger types of networks you might need other types of devices so you can see an addition to switches which are representing individual networks all of those networks than connected by one or more routers stepping back even farther news if we need to cont multiple networks together vi a ias peas or providers you can see now there is what's known as a wan link so that also mentioning you get up white nar's a metropolitan area net work which is typically within one particular city municpilarea or wide area a net works which can really span the entire globe. but you need a provider to give you those kinds of connections we spend a maritime this lesser discussing the os i model. so it's broken up into seven layers as you can see here with the color coming. the top three layers are really all about the application itself so you'll see presentation in session are mention there. but really most of the time we us bend talking about the application itself and give the examples are a the application being web or e mail or f tp under the hood each application is made up of one or more protocols more services that are allowing that application to function transport layer different protocols different job. it's not the application. its. how are we delivering the application the net work lair. how are we getting that data from the application from one place to another using proto calls. an addressing datalincon physical layer are more about connectivity using the net work card in getting that nick connected to particular device on your land.. we'll spend a lot of time dismiss or discussing the interaction of these seven layers of the side model if you have a good understanding of the side model. you'll do very very well of the rest of your networking courses. we'll go through the interaction of the layers and each device has a particular job to do each devices functioning at a particular layer of the side mob. so at the end of this chapter you'l understand each layer has a job each layer has something that's doing that job. and then each layer has either may be a piece of hard ware or saw wor sometimes both that'getting at accomplished. so that raps up chapter one we will discuss this and have a briefquisit our next

            "good morning welcome to you today's networking discussion on professor canard. we are here to go through chapter one of the text which is introduced to networking we. you be talking about what the purpose of network is for mainly the different types of devices as well as addressing the types of networks that you have and their applications.. we use different terms in networking that you'll see throughout the course o you hear network services. you might also hear the term application the purposes a network is there to share different types of what we call resources or resource could be a something as simple as a file or printer it could be a website. could be an entire er pea system so that we'll use the term resource as well as application under the hood. you might hearts use the term service or eaten farther under the surface. we might say protocol there are different types of applications that you'll see discussed in the text client server and peaked a pear being the two main types but you'll see others mentioned as well.. so if client server as you'll seen the listing that's the dominant type of networks that we see to day terms of application if. you see the list web e mal others it will get through throughout the course. but you can see those are really the man types of applications of fined to day there again. refer to as client servers. o be slide here. you can see the intricate which some people confuse from being the webthat. it's not the same thing. so the internet being the infrastructure. the series of connections of networks the users requesting a web page a vile wet browser that's the sompward running up their machine known is the client and h. you have web servers were running on the web servant will get more into that f future chapters other examples. e mal soy. we can say emails the application under the hood. there are a set of of one or more protocols that provide that service to the application so here you can see example such as sem t p pop three lots of alphabet suit the semester and will get into all of them. fa print a little that more basic but. that two represents in tapwlik application if i want to make files available devices such as printers available than you need to make those resources of elle somehow on the net that could be done in a fairly simple environment known is needed appear which is to say each system has a something that it's sharing a particular resource and then the other machines are functioning as clients that ae requesting the services on that particular machine. wet. you don't see in that slide. is any mention upper particular server. so it's a little bit simpler of a set up. oh the long hall can get a la bit more complicated so you can seen the slide there. it's simple for small networks. it's an expensive because you don't need complicated servoroperating systems. but you can see the problems are doesn't scale well. it doesn't grow as your needs change. and it's also not a secure. so client servigeyou cancer here being more dominant type of what you might call an administrative mob so all of the security los of the services might be a isolated on one or maybe several machines and then the clients are simply requesting those services from those one or more service that you have so nos network operatingsystem that would be something like serve orgyou candy on the slide or lines of popular servoroperating system as well.. now we will be getting into ah the different components hat you need for the network. so the application technically as one component. but as we get into more hardware types of things you'll see some devices mentioned in this live there or least in the diagram oe can see a switch mentioned as a particular device will see others such as hubs routers wireless access points and more that diagram also also referring to a particular typology or the design of the network that physical apologies you can see as what's known as a star topology sometimes called hub and spoke this like shows a combination of topology. so you have three separate devices that are connecting may be three separate class rooms three separate buildings three separate offices. and then they are all ar connected together on what's known as a bus topology a single line connecting them altogether.. larger types of networks you might need other types of devices so you can see an addition to switches which are representing individual networks all of those networks than connected by one or more routers stepping back even farther news if we need to cont multiple networks together vi a ias peas or providers you can see now there is what's known as a wan link so that also mentioning you get up white nar's a metropolitan area net work which is typically within one particular city municpilarea or wide area a net works which can really span the entire globe. but you need a provider to give you those kinds of connections we spend a maritime this lesser discussing the os i model. so it's broken up into seven layers as you can see here with the color coming. the top three layers are really all about the application itself so you'll see presentation in session are mention there. but really most of the time we us bend talking about the application itself and give the examples are a the application being web or e mail or f tp under the hood each application is made up of one or more protocols more services that are allowing that application to function transport layer different protocols different job. it's not the application. its. how are we delivering the application the net work lair. how are we getting that data from the application from one place to another using proto calls. an addressing datalincon physical layer are more about connectivity using the net work card in getting that nick connected to particular device on your land.. we'll spend a lot of time dismiss or discussing the interaction of these seven layers of the side model if you have a good understanding of the side model. you'll do very very well of the rest of your networking courses. we'll go through the interaction of the layers and each device has a particular job to do each devices functioning at a particular layer of the side mob. so at the end of this chapter you'l understand each layer has a job each layer has something that's doing that job. and then each layer has either may be a piece of hard ware or saw wor sometimes both that'getting at accomplished. so that raps up chapter one we will discuss this and have a briefquisit our next class.. \n",
