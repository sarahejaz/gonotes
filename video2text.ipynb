            "Morning, one computes networking discussion and professor canard were to go to chapter. One of the text which is introduction to networking were talking about what the purpose of the network is for mainly the different types of devices, as well as a dressing types of network that you have and their applications we licences and network in vigil setout the course so to her network service. Those. You might also hear the term application to proposes a network that share different types of what we call resources or resource could be something as simple as a file or a printer. It could be. A website could be an entire earpieces, so the willis, the tar resources well as application under the hood mightiest service refuter into the servants with might say, protocol trident types of applications. It all see disgust in the text, clientele and peter being the two main types which is of the machines. Well, so it cliverer as you'll see the listing at the double type of networks that we see to day in terms of applications and hostages were mail, others. It will give thee to the course, but you can see those are really the main types of applications of replied to it. There again refer to as client serves, so the fly here, eugene the internet, which a people could fuse from being the waists not the same thing so de internet being the infrastructure. The series of connections of networks to users requesting a web page, a vial web browser that the software right other machine on is the clinometer er software running on the web, servaret more into that future chapters. Other examples, email, somewise, evils the application under the book. There are a setterer protocols that provide that service to the application. So here you can see examples such as santipore lots of alphabet salesmen will get on to all of her fall print a little bit more basic, but that two represents a network application. I want to exciseable devices such as printers available than you need to make those resources bellesme, how long at that could be done in any fairly. He simply by men, not his peer appear, which is to say each system have something that I sharing the declare source and though the other machines are functioning as clients at her requesting the services on that particular machine. What do you donatives any mention of a particular service? So it's a little bit simpler of a set up a long halalea little bit more complicated. So you can see us live there, its simple for small networks, it's an expense of because you don't be complicated. Sir robert systems, but you can see the problems are, doesn't scale well, it doesn't grow as your deeds change and it's also not a secure, so clientele here being more dominantly micoatl model. So all of the security lots of the service is might be isolated on one or misera machines, and then the clients are simply requesting those services from those manoor service that you have so nonancourt ing sistina, be something like sir versions on the slide or limitismus server operating system as well. Now, when will be getting into a the different components, genesareth, so the application technically is one component. There is regentem hardwares of ingelis. Some devices mentioned in the life here or let in the diagram began a switch mentioned as a particular device will see others, duchess hubs, routers wiles access points and more that diagram, as also referring to a particular topology serve the design of the network that physical topas, you can see is what moteur to policy sometimes called a hub and spoke. This lie shows of a combination of depositor three separate devices that are connecting maybe three separate classrooms. There separate buildings through separate offices, and then they are all connected together on which manisees apology, a single line, commented mallet, larger touch of network. He might need other types of ticehurst switches which are representing individual networks. All of those networks are in connected by a wonder more routes, stepping back even farther now. So if we need to conical networks together by a I p or providers he can see now there is what's not as a wailing. So there lamenting you get out what's known metropolitan area network which is topically within one particular city, municipal area or wider network, which could really stand the entire globe, which you need a provider to give. You less times of connections was men a lot of time. This mister discussing the olimali its broken up into seven layers. As you can see her with the colour coating, the top three layers are really all about the application itself. So you see presentation in session of mention that burrell most as hamlen talking about the application of self in giving examples are of the application being whatever he mail or step under the hood. Each application is made up of one or more protocol or services that are allowing that application to function, transport layer, different protocols, different job, it's not the application is. How are we delivering capitation than network were how we getting that date from the application from one place to another using protocols, the dressing daily conseil layer are more about connective using the network hard again that next connected to particular device on your land. Most then a lot of hundreds mester discussing the interaction of these seven layers of the side model. If you have a good understanding of the side models, filey very well and the rest of your networking ego through the interaction of the layers and each device has a particular job to do. Each devices functioning at pedicular layer of the sidmouth. So the end of this chapel understand each layer has a job. Each layer has something that's doing that job many clear has either may be a piece of hardware or software, sometimes both the catacombs so that wraps up chapter one. We will discuss this and have quizzed a next class.\n"

He might need other types of ticehurst switches which are representing individual networks. All of those networks are in connected by a wonder more routes, stepping back even farther now.
